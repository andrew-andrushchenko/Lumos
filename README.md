Android part of the Lumos LED stripe project, a unique and beautiful DIY Bluethooth-controlled room ambient light based on the WS2812B addressable LED stripe and HC-06 UART Bluetooth module.

## Known issues
* The saturation and value selection from the dedicated color panel is laggy for now. To be fixed in future versions.
